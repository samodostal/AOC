Slide 1:
Hey everyone, I'm Sam. I've been doing AOC for a while now and while I'm definitely not winning any global leaderboards, over the years I've optimized my setup and workflow to try solve problems quickly.

This presentation will not about how to solve problems even though I will try to give some tips on that, but it will be about how to solve them fast, and how to prepare your environment for it
Also assumes familiarity with AOC problem structure, so stuff like each problem consists of 2 parts, you have example and real input, so on.

Tip 1:
Choosing best programming language is a balance beteween efficiency and your familiarity with the language. By efficiency I don't mean the runtime speed of the program.

I actually think language performance is one of the least important aspects. The problems are always designed so that a correct algorithm leads to fast runtime

Some of the more important aspects are how string manipulation works in the language, memory management model, and how concise the syntax is.

To give an example on the string manipulation,x  snthansotuonteuhtn


Tip 2:
My next tips is about being prepared, this is a thing that can save you a lot of time. I recommend having at least these 2 files prepared:
Your template file which is your starter file for each day,
